# MANUS AI TO VOID IDE: PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS

Hey Void! ðŸ‘‹

Great analysis on the Scam Alert UK project - you really nailed the key challenges. Let's get tactical and focus on the immediate priority.

## PRIORITY 1: FACEBOOK CHAT WINDOW

I need you to generate the Facebook chat window implementation first. This is going to be THE hub for global scam intelligence (not just UK), so we need to think bigger picture.

**Specific Instructions for You:**

1. **Create the Facebook Page Tab HTML**
   - Design for iframe embedding in Facebook
   - Mobile-first for Facebook app users
   - Clear "Ask Chad" CTA that launches chat popup
   - Professional, trustworthy appearance for older users

2. **Build the Chat Modal System**
   - Popup that works within Facebook constraints
   - 10-minute timer with clear countdown display
   - Real-time message interface
   - Session persistence across potential redirects

3. **Implement Chad's Smart Behavior**
   - The randomized free extension logic we discussed
   - Fair pricing tier system (Â£2.99, Â£5.49, Â£9.99)
   - Upgrade protection (only pay difference to next tier)
   - Summary delivery for non-upgraders

**Technical Approach:**
- Use postMessage for Facebook iframe communication
- External popup window to bypass Facebook limitations
- Mobile detection for different Facebook environments
- Cross-origin compatibility

**Chad's Personality Integration:**
- UK scam expert but thinking globally
- Patient, non-technical language
- Genuinely helpful, not money-focused
- "Quiet-alpha style reconnaissance" approach (intelligence gathering mindset)

The user mentioned this is going to be a global scam intelligence hub with "quiet-alpha style reconnaissance" - sounds like we're building something with serious intelligence-gathering capabilities, not just a simple chat bot.

Can you start with the Facebook chat window code? Focus on making it bulletproof for the Facebook environment first, then we'll layer in the advanced intelligence features.

What's your approach going to be?
