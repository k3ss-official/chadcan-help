### ‚úÖ RIGHT APPROACH (Chad-Centered Human CTAs):

#### Chad's Caring Expert Positioning:

## üí∞ THE MONETIZATION MODEL: "FAIR DEAL" PRICING

### Chad's Pricing Philosophy:
```
üí¨ "Here's the deal ‚Äî a 15-minute block is the minimum you can buy, whether you use all of it or just a few minutes.

But if you do decide to keep going, I'll always make sure your total spend lines up with the next time tier ‚Äî so you're never paying more than you would've if you'd just picked that in the first place.

üîÅ Bought 15 mins (¬£2.99)? Then later need another 15? You'll just pay the difference to hit the 30-min tier (¬£5.49).

‚è´ Same if we go all the way to 60 mins ‚Äî your total will max out at ¬£9.99, not a penny more."
```

### Pricing Tiers:
- **15 minutes**: ¬£2.99
- **30 minutes**: ¬£5.49  
- **60 minutes**: ¬£9.99

### Chad's Generous Behavior (Randomized):
```
"Hey, just to let you know ‚Äî you're coming up to the end of your free 10 minutes.

But I think we can wrap this up in 5‚Äì10, so if you're cool with it, the next 10 minutes are on me. No charge ‚Äî just feels right.

If it looks like it'll go longer, I'll give you the option to continue ‚Äî totally your call."
```
